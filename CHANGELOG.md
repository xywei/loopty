## [0.1.0.dev0] - 2026-09-18

The first release in which something works. A decorated kernel runs natively on
numpy, traces to a typed term, emits its obligations into lanky's ledger, lowers
through loopy, and runs on the C target. An illegal transformation is rejected
with a pair of statement instances.

### Added

- **Index types** (`loopty.idx`). `to_set(shape, params)` builds the isl set of a
  shape, with a non-affine axis size reflected into a fresh parameter, which
  widens soundly. `normalize` realises `Fin[a*b]` as `Fin[a] x Fin[b]`.
  `Layout` is the affine map of a dense row- or column-major array and
  `RaggedLayout(offsets)` the map of a dependent-sum axis; `linearize` and
  `delinearize` are the index arithmetic.
- **Runtime arrays** (`loopty.arr`). `Arr` over numpy, dense and ragged, with
  `Arr.zeros`, `Arr.from_numpy` and `Arr.ragged(counts, values)`; `.dom` is the
  iterable domain and `.dom[i]` the fiber over a row, with that row's extent;
  `.type` is the array's index type and `.numpy()` the buffer.
- **The Term IR** (`loopty.term`). `Access`, `Reduction`, `Stmt`, `ArrType` and
  `Term`: the contract between tracing and lowering. A statement carries its
  inames, its isl domain, its assignee, its expression, its guard and its source
  location.
- **Tracing** (`loopty.trace`). The body runs once against symbolic arrays.
  Subscripting builds an access, assignment records a statement, iterating a
  symbolic `.dom` opens a loop level whose iname is the name the `for` statement
  wrote, `loopty.sum` becomes a reduction, and `with when(cond):` records a guard
  that is also intersected into the statement's domain when it is affine. A
  Python `if` on a computed value raises `TraceError` naming `when` as the fix.
- **Footprints and dependences** (`loopty.flow`). Every statement instance is a
  point of one padded, statement-tagged space, so footprints, schedules and
  dependences are plain isl maps. Time is the 2d+1 vector of the loop nest. A
  ragged bound is reflected as an isl parameter, which is sound because isl
  answers for every value of it.
- **Typing rules** (`loopty.typing`). In-bounds per access, decided by isl when
  the index is affine and *by type* when the index's element type is the axis's
  index type, which is what discharges `x[col[r, j]]` with no proof at all.
  Write disjointness, an ordering obligation for the source schedule, the
  exactness class of each reduction, and the postcondition left to weaker
  oracles.
- **The isl oracle** (`loopty.oracle`). `Empty`, `Subset`, `Bijective` and
  `Monotone` question terms and the decision primitives behind them. A refuted
  fact carries a concrete witness: a point, or a pair of statement instances
  pulled back from time space.
- **Kernels** (`loopty.kernel`). `@kernel` is inert and registering: it runs
  natively, caches its term, and its `KernelTheory` turns it into facts under
  `lanky check`. `@program` sequences kernel calls and restates each callee's
  postcondition as a fact in scope.
- **Lowering** (`loopty.lower`). A term becomes an `lp.make_kernel`: domains from
  the statements, one assignment each with data-derived dependences, reductions
  as `lp.Reduction`, and a ragged axis as a flat buffer plus an offsets argument
  indexed `off[r] + j`, which is a genuine CSR loop.
- **Transformations as casts** (`loopty.schedule`). `Schedule(kernel).tag`,
  `.split`, `.interchange`, `.prioritize`, `.tile`, `.skew` and `.realize`. Each
  states its reindexing as an isl map, checks it is a bijection on statement
  instances, and checks the new execution order is monotone on the dependence
  relation. Failure raises `IllegalCast` carrying the rendered witness and the
  refuted fact, and the message names the sizes the witness was read off at.
  `.facts()` yields the cast facts for the ledger.
- **A target-capability check** (`loopty.schedule`). Legal and buildable are
  different questions, and a step that passes the first can still fail the
  second. A parallel tag inside a loop whose bound comes from an array (a ragged
  fiber), or a reduction split across parallel and sequential inames, produces a
  `refuted` fact of kind `buildable` decided by `loopy-target` with the limit in
  words, and `UnbuildableSchedule` is raised as soon as anything asks the
  schedule for code. Both limits were measured on real devices; see
  `docs/device-runs.md`. The design's own spmv device schedule is the case.
- **`Schedule.retarget(target)`**. The same transformations replayed against
  another loopy target, with every cast checked again and the buildability
  question re-asked, rather than relabelled.
- **Execution** (`loopty.executor`). `LoopyExecutor` runs a kernel, a schedule or
  a term through `lp.ExecutableCTarget` on numpy or `Arr` arguments, and
  `differential()` compares the compiled run against the Python body at the
  tolerance the exactness class states, returning a fact.
- **Commands.** `loopty run FILE [--target c|opencl] [--emit-code] [--json OUT]`
  and `loopty check FILE` (lanky's checker). `RunVerb` is registered under
  `lanky.verbs`, so `lanky run FILE` works too. `--target` retargets every
  schedule in the file and reports by name any that cannot be retargeted;
  without it each schedule keeps the target it was written for.
- **Four demos** (`examples/`) and `scripts/refresh_example_outputs.py`, which
  re-runs the commands pasted into `examples/README.md` and rewrites their
  output, so the document cannot drift from the code in silence.
- **Documentation.** `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/device-runs.md` with the
  transcripts under `docs/device-runs/`, and `docs/loopy-notes.md`: the loopy
  and islpy interactions that cost debugging time, each with its local
  workaround and the reason it is local.
- **Plugin surface** (`loopty.plugin`). `KernelTheory`, `IslOracle`,
  `LoopyExecutor` and `RunVerb`, exported through the four `lanky.*` entry-point
  groups. lanky never imports loopty; it finds these and asks each what it can do.

### Fixed

- The generated C function is renamed when the kernel's name is a C or OpenCL C
  keyword, or collides with an argument name (`def double(...)` used to emit
  `void double(...)`, which no compiler accepts). A *parameter* with such a name
  is refused instead, because renaming one would break every call.
- A CSR matrix whose rows are all empty runs on the C target. loopy tries to
  pass a null pointer for a zero-length array by calling the pointer type on
  `0.0`, which raises `TypeError: expected c_double instead of float`, so such a
  matrix could not be run at all. `executor` pads the flat buffer with one cell
  and restores the original afterwards, which is sound because no index into an
  empty array is in bounds. A kernel called with no rows at all still cannot
  run; see `docs/loopy-notes.md` for why the same trick does not apply there.
- A kernel body that iterates `.dom` accepts a plain `ndarray`: it is wrapped in
  `Arr`, sharing the buffer, instead of failing with `AttributeError: 'ndarray'
  object has no attribute 'dom'`.
- `KernelTheory` is registered once rather than twice. Importing
  `loopty.kernel` no longer registers it, because lanky's entry point already
  does; registration happens on demand instead.

### Changed

- **The accumulate convention is part of the Term IR.** `Stmt.kind ==
  "accumulate"` now *means* that `expr` is the complete right-hand side and
  reads the assignee cell, so `y[r] += t` is
  `Stmt(assignee=y[r], expr=y[r] + t)`. Lowering checks the invariant and
  refuses a term that breaks it, in place of a heuristic that inspected the
  expression and guessed.
- **A reduction's exactness class is derived rather than fixed.** It comes from
  the element sorts of what the reduction sums, joined so that the weakest wins:
  a sum of `Nat` is `exact`, a sum of `Real` is `approx`. `reassoc` is no longer
  something a trace assumes; it is what a schedule lowers an accumulation to
  when it reorders one, and `realize(var, tree=True)` over an `exact`
  accumulation is refused.
- `islpy` is pinned below 2026. loopy 2025.2 calls `Aff.is_equal` during code
  generation for a tiled loop nest and `BasicMap.is_bijective` in `map_domain`,
  and islpy 2026 removed both. Drop the ceiling once a loopy release supports
  islpy 2026.
- `lanky>=0.1.0.dev0` is a dependency, resolved from a sibling checkout by
  `[tool.uv.sources]` during development.

### Notes

- A kernel file needs `from __future__ import annotations` and a ruff `F821`
  per-file ignore, because a size such as `n` in `Arr[Fin[n], Real]` is a
  symbolic variable lanky invents while evaluating the annotation.
- An axis after the first is ragged when its size is a bare name that is also an
  array parameter of the same kernel: `val: Arr[Fin[n], Fin[cnt], Real]` next to
  `cnt: Arr[Fin[n], Nat]`. A symbolic inner size naming no parameter is read as
  an ordinary uniform size.
- The OpenCL target is written but never exercised on a development machine.
  Device runs happen elsewhere and are reported in `docs/device-runs.md`.
- Ragged bounds are reflected into isl as one parameter per occurrence, so
  `cnt[r]` and `cnt[r + 1]` are unrelated. An access against flat storage,
  `val[off[r] + j]`, is therefore reported `assumed` with the reason in its
  provenance, never `decided`; the ragged spelling `val[r, j]` is decided. See
  the module docstring of `loopty/flow.py`.
- The test suite treats `DeprecationWarning` as an error. Three exemptions are
  loopy's own and are listed in `pyproject.toml` and `tests/conftest.py`, with
  the reasons in `docs/loopy-notes.md`.
